Add option add key file to pagent for putty.
This is opposite of current 'run a coomand from pagent'.
Purpose is to allow pinning to taskbar to work correctly and merge putty and pagent icons..

Screen snapshot...
    Pushes a snap of the current screen into the scrollback.
    Might be very useful if it's the alternate screen.

Remove all trace of locked in UTF-8 mode.
    Keep "disable all character set controls" though.

Remove ANSISYS mode.

Local echo:
    If something comes down the line clear the pending input and redraw
    it after.

Use "GRCM" to override the CSI 10 m problem?
   CSI 21 h/l

Timer starvation occurs on unix (Not Windows)
    Need new timer starvation fix!
    Can be triggered with the "tack" program's padding tests.
	(PuTTY does NOT need padding, except it may help with this.)

CSI ? 12 h -- Turn on blinking cursor. From "att610" via XTerm
CSI ? 12 l -- Turn off blinking cursor. From "att610" via XTerm

CSI Ps SP q	(via XTerm)
          Set cursor style (DECSCUSR, VT520).
            Ps = 0  -> blinking block.
            Ps = 1  -> blinking block (default).
            Ps = 2  -> steady block.
            Ps = 3  -> blinking underline.
            Ps = 4  -> steady underline.
            Ps = 5  -> blinking bar (xterm).
            Ps = 6  -> steady bar (xterm).

Should I remove 256 colours from the 'Frontends' ?
    Replace with a pallette managed by terminal.c, frontends know about
    16 colours (System defined to be like the VGA colours) and 24 bit
    overrides that they ignore if the "256 Colour mode" is turned off.

    Frontend is still informed if the first 16 colours are redefined
    but they can ignore this too.

    Redefinition of 256 colours could be supported in this case; perhaps
    even redefinition of 32767 colours.

DLL interface
    Allow other emulations, with the lookahead buffer we now have a method
    of allowing another emulation to intercept some or all of the functions.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For UTF8 Update
    Pull 'compatibility' updates out into own patch

    Should lookahead buffer be a bag (self expanding) ?

    MBCS addition: take note that wchar_t is UTF16 on Windows. ****! ****! ****!
	Fix mb_to_wc ?

    Other codepages configured from host ?

    POSIX 2001 adds the wcwidth() to the C library.
    But, Unicode.org keeps changing it.
    Existing version is frozen based on a specific version of the standard,
    The Width override sequence can be used to fix any errors.

CSI function to select function key layout.
    Put it into the terminfo init & reset sequences (perhaps even into smcup)
    and the function keys will never be wrong.
    
    REJECT.

Unicode Fonts

    It would appear that there will remain very few fonts that covert the
    entire unicode range. PuTTY should allow a more general method for
    selecting fonts for various ranges.

    The best method for specifing these ranges is not clear.

    Windows is also having this problem; it solution is to lie to the
    application and pretend that all fonts have all characters even if
    this breaks the "monospaced font" rule.

Portable PuTTY

    Give the Windows version a "-load" flag to load a Unix session file.
	-- Problem SSH host keys.
	-? Only one needed per remote, add to session file ?
	-? Conflict between session host key and system ? Timestamp?

Use TCL or other scripting language for the dialog box.

    Makes the configuration an external app, PuTTY keeps running naturally.
    Needs IPC to prod putty to reload 'Current Config'.
	Process termination and file modification time ?

    Get expanding boxes, nice scripting etc etc.
    Easy, for more people, to modify.
    Can have 'start and stay open' for config box (AKA real apply button).
    Dumb replacements too "pterm -e vi $HOME/.putty/tmp/Config.1234"

Dynamic Attributes

    Some attributes don't need interpretation in the display driver as they
    don't have a unique display 'footprint'. These attributes could be stored
    only in the current state in the term structure.

    ATTR_BLINK		    Just redraw					(5)
    ATTR_BLINK As BGBOLD    Use different colours			(5)
    ATTR_REVERSE	    Swap the colours				(7)
    ATTR_SELECTION	    Swap the colours again			(-)
    ATTR_ITALIC		    Swap the colours yet again ("standout")	(3)
    ATTR_DIM		    Use different colours			(2)
    ATTR_CONCEAL	    Use different colours			(8)
    ATTR_BGBOLD             Use different colours			(6?)

    Bold is usually just a colour change too.

    ATTR_BOLD		    Use different colours			(1)

    Some of these would still need representation in the display array
    in terminal.c, for example ATTR_BLINK needs to get translated to a
    physical representation on the fly for 'Blink On' and 'Blink Off'.

    Does this mean we want a new ATTR_* set just for terminal.[ch] ?

    Physical attributes:
	ATTR_FGCOLOUR	256 & 24 bit? Note: 24bit always works.
	ATTR_BGCOLOUR
	ATTR_BOLD	Font only.					(1)
	ATTR_ULINE	Font or overstrike.				(4)
	ATTR_CROSS	Strike through? Font?				(9)

    Conditional, terminal.c needs to change on a timer or event.
	ATTR_SELECTION
	ATTR_CONCEAL
	ATTR_BLINK	Not bright BG.
