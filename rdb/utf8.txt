    12.2 Identification of a UCS encoding scheme

    When the escape sequences from ISO/IEC 2022 are used, the
    identification of a UCS encoding scheme (see Clause 9) specified
    by this International Standard shall be by a designation sequence
    chosen from the following list:

    ESC 02/05 02/15 04/09
	 UTF-8 encoding form; UTF-8 encoding scheme
    ESC 02/05 02/15 04/12
	 UTF-16 encoding form; UTF-16BE encoding scheme
    ESC 02/05 02/15 04/06
	 UTF-32 encoding form; UTF-32BE encoding scheme

	  NOTE - The following designation sequences: ESC 02/05 02/15
	  04/00, ESC 02/05 02/15 04/01, ESC 02/05 02/15 04/03, ESC
	  02/05 02/15 04/04, ESC 02/05 02/15 04/07, ESC 02/05 02/15
	  04/08, ESC 02/05 02/15 04/10, ESC 02/05 02/15 04/11 used in
	  previous versions of this standard to identify implementation
	  levels 1 and 2 are deprec ated. The remaining designation se-
	  quences correspond to the former level 3 which is now the only
	  supported content definition for code unit sequences.

    ESC 02/05 04/07
	 UTF-8 encoding form; UTF-8 encoding scheme

    If such an esc ape sequence appears within a code unit sequence
    conforming to ISO/I EC 2022, it s hall consist only of the sequences
    of bit combinations as shown above.  If such an escape sequence
    appears within a code unit sequence conforming to this International
    Stand- ard, it shall be padded in accordance with Clause 11 when the
    identified encoding form is either UTF-16 or UTF-32. No padding is
    necessary when the identified encoding form is UTF-8. See also 12.5.



UTF-8 processing update

*) Removed the locking of terminal in UTF-8 mode.
*) The alt_utf flag is removed
*) The saved_utf flag is removed.

    DOCS standard return always works when no_remote_charset is off.

    The automatic locking of the utf flag for UTF-8 fonts is confusing
    in that it means there are two distinct versions of PuTTY control
    sequences (with or without ISO-2022) without an obvious configuration
    warning. In addition for current versions of PuTTY the functionality
    is provided by the option to disable remote control of character sets.

    The utf flag is not controlled by most host software, only specialist
    software (and scripts) that understand ISO-2022 and UTF-8 will use
    it. Therefor the existance of multi copies of the flag (alt & saved)
    is not useful and has caused confusion.

*) All ISO-2022 controls (except ESC % @) are properly ignored in utf-8 mode.

    When the 'DOCS return' sequence is used the ISO-2022 engine must
    be returned to exactly the state it was in when the original 'DOCS'
    was received. (ECMA-035)

*) Under Debian/Ubuntu my locale is en_GB.utf8, not *UTF-8*.
*) Some UTF-8 locales don't have a utf8 suffix eg: en_AG, en_IN, en_NG

    The locale detection is updated.

*) Added rxvt compatible UTF-8 mode for ISO-2022 and UTF-8 at the same time.
*) CSI Pn SP D used to allow host switching to rxvt mixed mode.

    The rxvt compatibility (wishlist/utf8-plus-vt100) means that all the
    ISO-2022 sequences can be made to continue to work while in UTF-8
    mode. This is only reasonable when you have a hellspawn host that
    has an unlabeled mixture of unicode and non-unicode applications and
    data but it can still be useful.  (eg: if parts of your filesystem
    have been around for nearly 20 years like mine) Even then there
    are reasonable arguments that this should be done by translation
    applications not an emulator. For my usage this is a 'normally off'
    option that can be turned on to 'get the ****ing thing working'.

    The pure UTF-8 mode is still the default. Note: As the escape sequence
    to get into the mixed mode is NOT an ISO-2022 sequence the rules
    about DOCS restoring the ISO-2022 state do not apply.

    This mixed mode also means that the UTF-8 decoder had to be changed;
    instead of mostly using an FSM with a single character lookahead
    buffer the UTF-8 decoder has been changed to use only a lookahead
    buffer.

    This buffer is also used instead of the tiny FSM for the printer
    output and is likely to be a good solution for any other emulation
    extensions including full ISO-2022, the Windows MBCS encodings,
    the Japanese style auto-detection of character encoding and even
    full emulation replacements like a hardline VT220 or Wyse.

*) Add a config switch to control the new UTF-8 modes on reset.

    Option sets the value of the term->utf field on reset.

    The configuration values are
	0 => off
	Terminal uses the configured codepage after a reset.
	1 => on
	Terminal uses UTF-8 after a reset, DOCS RETURN is used to get to
	the configured codepage.
	2 => mixed
	Terminal uses UTF-8 after a reset. But if the character sequence
	isn't legal UTF-8 it will be treated as the configured codepage.

    Rather than overriding the line character set, the UTF8 locale
    override forces this flag to UTF-8. This means that the 8bit codepage
    is still available if the host explicitly requests it (ISO8859-1 if
    the line codepage is UTF-8)

Trigger for UTF-8 change ...

The UTF-8 functionality of most host software is controlled through
the 'locale' functions. These have no built in facilities for sending
initilisation sequences to a terminal to change it's mode. However,
a host script can change the locale and so should be able to change the
terminal to match.

    if [ "`locale charmap 2>/dev/null`" = "UTF-8" ]
    then echo -ne '\033%G'		# DOCS UTF-8
    else echo -ne '\033%@'		# DOCS RETURN
    fi

Most utf-8 software expects normal sequences to have no effect on a
UTF-8 terminal, ncurses for example may still send smacs strings even
when using UTF-8 line drawing characters.

It might be reasonable to do this in curses, but no version of curses
understands ISO-2022. Some, however, do understand UTF-8, in a very
limited fashion.  Plus the Japaneese style implementations of ISO-2022
are both more complete and more limited; giving more character sets but
limiting their usage to overcome problems not forseen by the standard.

For the future it's likely that the terminal will run mostly in UTF-8
so this mode will become even less useful.
